***Hot Browser Refresh***

Hot Browser Refresh is a utility written in Javascript and executed in the
NodeJS platform.  This utility watches directories that contains certain 
application assets (*.css, *.html, *.js).  When these type of files are changed,
the utility will open the configured browser, if not open, or reload the browser
if currently open.  This will allow a developer to make source changes and not
have to perform the tedious task of refreshing the browser to view the changes.

Command:
node reload_browser.js -b <browser> -d <directory to watch> -a <application url>

-b <browser> The browser to reload. Defaults to 'firefox'
-a <application URL> The url of the application to reload the browser.
-d <directory> The directory to watch for changes.
